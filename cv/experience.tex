        \begin{cvitems}
            \item {proposed and currently leading a novel search for new physics in Higgs boson interactions, with results competitive with world best (work in progress).}
            \item {contributed to precision Higgs measurement: modelling uncertainty studies with high-dimensional reweighting techniques (based on neural networks) and fit model development, critical for the precision of the final result (in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19611}{arXiv:2410.19611}, submitted to JHEP).}
            \item {contributed to ATLAS search of production of high-energy Higgs bosons: defined optimal signal identification criteria and signal-background separation strategies, leading to 4-5\% improvement in performance (in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2021.136204}{Physics Letters B 816 (2021) 136204}).}
