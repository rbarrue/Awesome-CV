        \textbf{Simulation-based inference methods for searches of BSM physics in the HWW interaction in WH production}\vspace{12pt}
        \begin{cvitems}      
            \item {spearheading the group's exploration of simulation-based-inference methods, proposing and supervising a study of likelihood ratio estimators based on neural networks.}
            \item {explored an estimator of a sufficient statistic of the likelihood (score), published in \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP04(2024)014}{J. High Energ. Phys. 2024, 14 (2024)} (main author).}

    {ATLAS Collaboration}
    {Member}
    {}
    {Oct. 2018 - PRESENT}
    {
        \textbf{Higgs boson measurements in VH production}\vspace{14pt}
        \begin{cvitems}
            \item {leading the first ATLAS search for BSM CP-violating components in HWW vertex in WH production. Results competitive with world best (work in progress). Internal note: \href{https://cds.cern.ch/record/2921718}{ATL-COM-PHYS-2025-031}.}
            \item {contributed to the combined $VH(\to b\bar{b}/c\bar{c})$ measurement: shape modelling uncertainty studies with high-dimensional reweighting techniques (based on neural networks) and fit model development (in \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP04(2025)075}{J. High Energ. Phys. 2025, 75 (2025)}).}
            \item {contributed to the first ATLAS search of $VH(\to b\bar{b})$ in the high-momentum regime: defined optimal Higgs boson identification and signal-background separation strategies (in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2021.136204}{Physics Letters B 816 (2021) 136204}). Granted exceptional ATLAS authorship before the PhD due to the relevance of the contributions.}

        \begin{cvitems}
            \item {validated jet trigger efficiencies with 2022 data (in \href{https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/19/06/P06029}{JINST 19 P06029}).}
            \item {defined the optimal track, vertex and Particle Flow reconstruction parameters with simulated data.}
